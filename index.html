<h1> Re: Albert Momo University application</h1>
<hr>

<p> Dear Mr. Momo,</p>
<p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the starz University's Science faculty to study as part of your PhD next year.I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>

<br>
<h2>Starting dates</h2>

<p> We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at beginning of a semsester; starrt dates for each one are as follows:</p>
<br>
<p>First semsester: 9 October 2022 <br> Second semsester: 15 january 2023 <br> Third semsester: 2 May 2023 </p>
<br>
<p> Please let me know is this is ok, and is so which start date you would prefer.</p> <br>
You can find more information about important university dates on ours website. <br>
<h2> <strong>Subjects of Study</strong> </h2>

<p>At the Starz University, We have a pretty open-minded research facility__as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent,dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>

<P>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of <b>R</b>esveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.) Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30*C(86*F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3X<sup></sup>10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3X<sup></sup>10<sup>4.</sup></p>

<p> <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong></p>
<br>
<p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how you'd expect the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.</p>
<br>
<p><h2> <strong>Exotic dance moves</strong></h2></p>
<p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study exotic tribal dances. To answer yoour question, my favourite dances are as follows, witth definitions:</p>
<p>Polynesian Chicken dance</p>
<p>A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitfil".<br>Icelandic brownian shuffle<br> <strong>B</strong>efore the <b>I</b>celanders developed fire as <b>a</b> means of getting warm, they used to pratice this dance, which involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptibly tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modern styles such as <strong>T</strong>werking. </p>
<p>Arctic robot dance</p>
<p>An interesting exmple of historic misinformtion, English explorers in 1960s believed to have discovered a new dance style characterizedby "robotic",stilted movements, being praticed by inhabitants of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because they were really cold.</p>
<br>
<p>For more of my research, see my exotic dance research page.<br> 
<br> Yours sincerely,<br> <br>Pro. Henery Nana <br> <br>
